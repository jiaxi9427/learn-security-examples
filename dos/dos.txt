- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The code introduces an exception handling mechanism that uses try-catch blocks to catch and handle possible errors.
In the catch block, the code returns a generic error response of "Bad input" instead of exposing a detailed error message. 
This avoids revealing sensitive information to attackers.

The introduction of exception handling mechanism can prevent application crashes or errors caused by malicious input, 
and improve application stability and availability.
Returning a generic error response can limit an attacker's access to sensitive information, 
such as database structures or query statements, thereby reducing the risk of information disclosure.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

I have the following suggestions: Input Validation and Sanitization, 
Parameterized Queries or ORM, Least Privilege Principle, 
Rate Limiting and Monitoring, Regular Security Audits and Updates.
