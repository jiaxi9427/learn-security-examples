- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.

Request Logging: 
By logging each request, including method, URL, and the requester's IP address, 
the application creates an audit trail that can be used to trace actions back to their source. 
This makes it more difficult for users to deny their activities on the application.

Simulated User Authentication: 
While only a placeholder, this represents a step towards verifying the identity of users performing sensitive actions. 
In practice, implementing actual authentication mechanisms (e.g., using passwords, tokens) would ensure 
that only legitimate users can perform certain actions, further tying those actions to specific individuals.

Error Logging: 
Capturing and logging errors serve a dual purpose of improving application stability 
and recording potential malicious activities that result in exceptions.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

Implement Strong Authentication: 
Utilize robust authentication methods like Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) 
to ensure that the user's identity is accurately verified before allowing access to sensitive functions.

Digital Signatures: 
Implement digital signatures for critical actions within the application. 
By requiring data to be signed with the user's private key, you can ensure non-repudiation, 
as only the user with the corresponding private key could have performed the action.
